# GitHub Code Analysis Tool

## Project Purpose

This project provides a framework for deep code understanding that enables AI agents to comprehensively analyze and work with GitHub repositories. The framework is designed to be AI model agnostic, focusing on:

- Deep code structure analysis and representation
- Dependency and relationship mapping
- Code context and semantic understanding
- Framework and pattern recognition
- Cross-repository knowledge integration

Our ultimate goal is to enable AI agents to autonomously understand and work with codebases at a level that allows them to contribute meaningful code changes and participate in development.
