# Guide for AI Assistants

## Project Overview

This is an enterprise-grade GitHub repository analyzer designed to provide AI assistants with deep understanding of codebases.

## Quick Start

1. Review these files first:
   - docs/development/OVERVIEW.md (Project status)
   - dev_logs/2024_03_tree_sitter.md (Current development)
   - docs/development/GUIDELINES.md (Project structure & standards)

2. Key Components:
   - Models: Define data structures and errors
   - Services: Implement core functionality
   - Utils: Provide shared utilities
   - Config: Handle application settings

3. Current Development Focus:
   - Advanced Tree-sitter parsing
   - Test failures in test_tree_sitter_advanced.py
   - Memory optimization

4. Development Workflow:
   - Check dev_logs/ for latest status
   - Review failing tests before making changes
   - Update dev logs after significant changes
   - Maintain type hints and documentation

## Important Notes

- Project is AI model agnostic
- Focus on maintainable, typed code
- Heavy emphasis on testing
- Documentation is critical
