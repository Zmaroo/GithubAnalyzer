Conversation from previous conversation (the big picture of what we are trying to do with query patterns)


 Broadening the Coverage:
 • Today, many of our patterns focus on functions, classes, enums, and decorators. To capture a fuller picture of the code, we should also include patterns for:
  – Import/Include statements (to capture dependencies)
  – Variable declarations and assignments (to capture state and data flows)
  – Control flow constructs (if/else, switch, loops, try/except, etc.)
  – Expressions (such as lambda expressions or call expressions)
  – Comments and docstrings (if those are critical for metadata and documentation)
2. Templates vs. Hard-Coded Patterns:
 • For many common languages (like JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++), we have already developed hard-coded patterns that have been tuned with extensive testing. These are useful because they capture the nuances and corner cases of each language.
 • However, for less common languages or for constructs that follow a standard structure, we can leverage our templates (with our create_function_pattern, create_class_pattern, and create_method_pattern functions) supplemented by optional configuration dictionaries.
 • A hybrid approach is ideal: use dedicated, hard-coded patterns for the core constructs in the most popular GitHub repo languages, and use our templates (which can be enhanced via configuration dictionaries) for extending coverage to additional constructs or other languages.
3. Modifications to QUERY_PATTERNS:
 • We will add new keys to the QUERY_PATTERNS dictionary to cover the additional constructs. For example, we can add an "import" key with a pattern designed to capture both ES6-style imports in JavaScript and similar constructs in other languages.
 • Similarly, we can add keys for "variable", "conditional", "loop", "assignment", etc. Each of these would be defined either as a hard-coded query or, if possible, via a new template (perhaps with functions similar to create_method_pattern) that can be configured per language.
4. Outcome for the AI Agent:
 • By storing this richer, more complete set of AST data—including functions, classes, methods, variables, control flow structures, and more—in both our relational (PostgreSQL) and graph (Neo4j) databases, the AI agent will have a much more detailed view of the codebase.
 • This enhanced representation can then enable advanced querying and analysis, which in turn can empower the AI agent to “reconstruct” or even re-code parts of a project based on deep structural insights.
In summary:
– Yes, we can modify our hard-coded patterns to capture a more complete set of code constructs.
– We may need to add new patterns (or even new templates) for constructs like imports, assignments, control flows, and comments.
– For popular languages, it might make sense to keep these as hard-coded, tuned patterns, while for others, our enhanced templating system (with configuration dictionaries) can cover the necessary variation.
– This combined approach will help ensure that we store as much useful information as possible, enabling an AI agent to leverage a rich, detailed representation when coding or analyzing a project.
Would you like to explore specific modifications to add these new patterns or discuss which particular elements are highest priority for capturing?

Exploring Specific Modifications to Add New Patterns
We can modify our QUERY_PATTERNS dictionary (or add new keys) to capture additional constructs. Here are some concrete examples:
a. Import Statements:
For languages like JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python, we could add patterns to capture imports.
  • For JavaScript/TypeScript (if not already present in the JS_VARIANT_PATTERNS):
    "import": """
     [
      (import_statement
      source: (string) @import.source
      clause: (import_clause)? @import.clause)
     ] @import
    """,
  • For Python:
    "import": """
     [
      (import_statement
      module: (dotted_name)? @import.module)
      (from_import_statement\n module: (dotted_name) @import.from_module\n names: (import_as_names) @import.names)
     ] @import
    """,
b. Variable Declarations/Assignments:
A pattern for capturing variable assignments could look like this:
  "variable": """
    [
     (assignment_expression\n left: (identifier) @variable.name\n right: () @variable.value)
    ] @variable
  """,
This would let you capture variable names and their initial values.
c. Control Flow Constructs (Conditionals, Loops, etc.):
For conditionals, you could add a pattern such as:
  "conditional": """
    (if_statement\n condition: (parenthesized_expression)? @conditional.condition\n consequence: (block) @conditional.consequence\n (else_clause (block) @conditional.alternative)?\n) @conditional
  """,
For loops:
  "loop": """
    [
     (for_statement\n declaration: (variable_declaration)? @loop.declaration\n body: (block) @loop.body)
     (while_statement\n condition: (parenthesized_expression)? @loop.condition\n body: (block) @loop.body)
    ] @loop
  """,
d. Decorators/Annotations:
While we already have a basic pattern for decorators, make sure it is tuned for each language where decorators are a major part (e.g., in Python or TypeScript).
e. Additional Constructs:
Depending on your needs, you might also want to add patterns for lambdas/arrow functions (which may already be partly covered in the function patterns) or for specific expressions. For example, a pattern for lambda expressions in Python might be:
  "lambda": """
    (lambda) @lambda
  """,
────────────────────────────────────
In summary:
We would enhance our QUERY_PATTERNS by adding new keys for the additional elements listed above.
For each key, you decide if a hard-coded query or a templated approach (using our enhanced create__pattern functions) is best.
For popular languages, hard-coded patterns that have been fine-tuned through testing might be preferable.
For less common languages or constructs that follow a consistent structure, our templated approach (with optional config dictionaries) should be sufficient.
The ultimate goal is to store a complete and rich representation of the code in our databases so that the AI agent can later extract and reason about every part of the project, from functions and classes to control flows and variable relationships.
Would you like to proceed with adding specific new patterns for any of these additional elements, or discuss which language(s) we should target first for these enhancements?
